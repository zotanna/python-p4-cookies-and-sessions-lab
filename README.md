# Cookies and Sessions Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use the session object to persist data across multiple requests.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: a subfield of software engineering that
  focuses on users, their attributes, their login information, and the resources
  that they are allowed to access.
- **Authentication**: proving one's identity to an application in order to
  access protected information; logging in.
- **Authorization**: allowing or disallowing access to resources based on a
  user's attributes.
- **Session**: the time between a user logging in and logging out of a web
  application.
- **Cookie**: data from a web application that is stored by the browser. The
  application can retrieve this data during subsequent sessions.

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll be building out a blog paywall feature by using the session
hash to keep track of how many page views a user has made.

There is some starter code in place for a Flask API backend and a React
frontend. To get set up, run:

```console
$ pipenv install && pipenv shell
$ npm install --prefix client
$ cd server
$ flask db upgrade
$ python seed.py
```

You can work on this lab by running the tests with `pytest -x`. It will also be
helpful to see what's happening during the request/response cycle by running the
app in the browser. You can run the Flask server with:

```console
$ python app.py
```

And you can run React from the root directory in another terminal with:

```console
$ npm start --prefix client
```

You don't have to make any changes to the React code to get this lab working.

## Instructions

Our app will keep track of how many blog posts a user has viewed by using the
`session` object. Each user can view a **maximum of three articles** before
seeing the paywall.

When a user makes a `GET` request to `/articles/<int:id>`, the following should
happen:

- If this is the first request this user has made, set `session['page_views']` to
  an initial value of 0.
  - **Hint**: consider using a ternary operator to set this initial value!
- For every request to `/articles/<int:id>`, increment the value of
  `session['page_views']` by 1.
- If the user has viewed 3 or fewer pages, render a JSON response with the
  article data.
- If the user has viewed more than 3 pages, render a JSON response including an
  error message `{'message': 'Maximum pageview limit reached'}`, and a status code
  of 401 unauthorized.
- An API endpoint at `/clear` is available to clear your session as needed.
